      To get started:

        warpsend run

      This downloads the agent daemon, opens the login UI, and starts
      transferring. On macOS, you can also install the desktop app:

        warpsend gui install
        open /Applications/WarpSend.app
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "warpsend", shell_output("#{bin}/warpsend --version")
  end
end
