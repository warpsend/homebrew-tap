    # file under current Homebrew, so `brew link` finds nothing to link and the
    # CLI never lands on PATH.

  # No post_install: Homebrew's sandbox blocks writes to

      To get started:

        warpsend run

      This installs the agent daemon, opens the login UI, and starts
      transferring.
