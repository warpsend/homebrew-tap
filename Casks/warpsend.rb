  app "WarpSend.app"
  # The .app bundles the supervisor CLI at Contents/MacOS/bin/warpsend; link it
  # onto PATH so `warpsend ...` works in the terminal too. It also bundles the
  # agent daemon, so first run seeds the slot locally — no post-install fetch.
  binary "#{appdir}/WarpSend.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/warpsend"

  caveats <<~EOS
    WarpSend is in /Applications and `warpsend` is on your PATH. Launch the
    app and sign in — it bundles the agent daemon and CLI, so there are no
    extra downloads.
    After `brew upgrade`, launch WarpSend once and approve the admin prompt if
    macOS asks; the app self-heals the background service on launch.

  # First launch installs a root LaunchDaemon (io.warpsend.agent) + machine-wide
  # data. Without an uninstall/zap, `brew uninstall` would orphan a root daemon
  # and its root-owned files (the "Trash doesn't fully uninstall" problem).
